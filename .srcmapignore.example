# .srcmapignore — gitignore-style patterns for srcmap file exclusion
#
# Copy this file to `.srcmapignore` at your workspace root and customize.
# Patterns use the same syntax as .gitignore:
#   - Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored
#   - Standard glob patterns work (*, ?, [abc])
#   - A pattern without a slash matches at any directory level
#   - Prefix ! to negate (re-include a previously excluded pattern)
