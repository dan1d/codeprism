## Why not just use Cursor Teams?

**One-liner**: Cursor Teams is a great *editor*. Codeprism is the *shared, tool-agnostic engineering memory* that persists across repos, tools, and time — with governance, evaluation, and durability Cursor doesn’t provide.

### The crisp bullets

- **Tool-agnostic “shared brain”**: Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, VS Code, and future tools — you don’t bet your org memory on one IDE.
- **Cross-repo + cross-surface memory**: Indexes multiple repos and knowledge surfaces (flows/cards/docs/metrics) into an org view, not a per-editor session view.
- **Governance + durability**: Central policies, auditability, and long-lived knowledge artifacts that survive onboarding, vendor churn, and prompt drift.
- **Quality + evaluation loop**: Benchmarks and diagnostics make retrieval measurable (hit/miss, fallbacks, probe repair), so “memory” isn’t a vibe — it’s testable.
- **Org-scale incentives**: Built for CTO/eng leadership outcomes: consistent decisions, fewer rewrites, faster onboarding — not just faster autocomplete.

### When you still pick Cursor Teams

If you only need better in-editor assistance for a single repo and don’t care about durable, shared, evaluatable org memory, Cursor Teams is often enough.
